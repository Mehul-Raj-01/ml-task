Initially we start with a given csv file having 33 different featurs out of which the three features are unknown . Based on their values and realtion with the other features we have to find their values .
For that we have used different kinds of plots based on the inital heatmap plot and get the hidden paramets as age , academic exposure and social exposure .  
Then we move on to the level 2 wher we have to make the impurtations on the missing values of the data . By using the mean , meadian , mode and some other correlation techinques we have achived this for the different columns depending on their type.  
Then we move on to the level 3 where we have to make the some question to interpret the data based on the graphs and observation . There I made 8 different questions that provides a deep insight into the datasheet.  
Then i finally moved to the level 4 where i have trained 3 different models and out of them SVM stands the best by the comparision of various parametes such as accuracy precision F1 score etc.    
Then we used the SHAP tools to interpete the real meaning of the data in the level 5.
